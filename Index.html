        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <img src="https://www.globalr2p.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Syria_64.png" alt="Map of Syria">
        <p>I am a 16 year old student in highschool. I was born in Damascus, Syria but around five years later I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina.
        I am currently a junior at the Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnology. 
        I have a focus in computer programming, meaning I take mostly information technology and compuetr programming classes. 
        By going to this school I hope to gain knowledge about the technology field which help me in my future endeavors.
        The program that my school follows offers an associates degree if I do another year after the 12th grade.

        Now although my school offers an associates degree, I am not looking into doing a 13th year. 
        Instead after highschool I will be going to a four year college. 
        I have yet to figure put exactly what I want to major in but I am looking into Finance or Business Analytics degree. 
        The school I currently go to is helpful for both of these majors because both require some background knowledge in tech. 
        For example, both use Excel and due to the fact I attend this high school I have already taken a class in Excel and have a certificate in Excel.

        After college I will hopefully get a job oppurtunity somewhere on the East coast of the U.S. like Washington D.C. or Boston. 
        I hope to be able to travel all around the world and be well versed many different cultures. 
        Also while traveling I hope to be able to give back to the community and connect with the locals. 
        I might not have exact plans in mind for my future but I have goals which will guide my future.
        Hopefully I will be able to accomplish all the goals and I end up fullfilled with the life I have lived.
