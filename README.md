A brief description of your Github account: This account is made for coding in a coding class.
A brief description of the repository you created: This repository is made for holding all the coding projects I have throughout my class.
A brief description of the steps you took to clone the repository onto your local machine: I was able to clone this repository by first opening an account through GitHub web then creating a repository on my just opened web account. After I logged in to the newly created GitHub account on the GitHub desktop app. Where when I opened gave me an option to create a repository or clone one along with other options. I chose to clone the repository and I was able to easily find the repository that I had created on web by being on the same GitHub account that I made it on orginally. I saved the clone to a folder and that was it.
