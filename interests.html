        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pottery:</strong> I started liking pottery after an 8th grade 3d art class. We made a lot different things using pottery. Now I mainly buy airdry clay and make it at home but sometimes I go to little pottery workshop places.</li>
            <li><strong>Legos:</strong>Recently I got really into legos. It began after I was gifted a flower bouquet lego set by my friends. Ever since then my lego collection has grown.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking:</strong> As a kid I would bake boxed pre-mixes. As I grew up I got into baking from scratch. Mainly I bake Banana bread and cookies but want to learn to bake bread.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Ive recently been learning to cook because I like to experiment in the kitchen. I help my mo out a lot which helps me get tips and tricks.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawing:</strong> Ever since I was a kid I have loved to draw. I like to doodle a lot on my work at school. But I also love to draw plants and animals in my sketchbook.</li>
